# Project Flippi

Welcome to **Project Flippi**!  
This repository is the codebase for automated clip compilations and YouTube posting.
## Overview

Project Flippi is your highlight autopilot â€” capturing the hypest Super Smash Bros. Melee moments and flipping them straight onto YouTube so players and TOs can focus on what matters: playing more Melee.
## Features

- Processes combo data jsonl files generated by [[Project Clippi]] to generate prompts. Prompts are provided to AI to generate titles and descriptions. 
- Generates compilations of combo clips with title, description, and thumbnail.
- Uploads clips as shorts and compilations as vidoes to YouTube on a defined schedule.
## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/project-flippi/project-flippi.git
cd project-flippi
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Upon your first use of this project or when you need to create a new event folder with the associated data files needed for an upcoming tourney, a new weekly, or a new content series, run FolderCreation.py and follow the prompts
cd project-flippi
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python FolderCreation.py

#Place your Google API OAuth 2 client secret in _keys>client_secret.json
#Place your OpenAI API key in _keys>open_AI_key.json

# Next, before you go to an event to record footage, update your Project Clippi actions to write data to a file when a combo/conversion event occurs. 
# The data to write is
# {"timestamp":"{{YYYY}}-{{MM}}-{{DD}} {{HH}}-{{mm}}-{{ss}}","trigger":"filter","source":"{{comboSource}}","phase":"{{comboPhase}}","active":"{{liveHasActiveCombo}}","event":{{ComboEventPayload}}}
# The file to write to is combodata.jsonl located within Event>Your Created Event>data
```

### Usage

```bash
#After you successfully record footage using OBS and Project Clippi for the tourney/weekly/your personal content series, run the following code
cd project-flippi
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```
